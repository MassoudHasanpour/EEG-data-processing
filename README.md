The objective of this project is to visualize the provided EEG data, analyze it, and employ statistical and ML techniques to determine if it is possible to differentiate between different classes of EEG signals. The data is divided into five files, each specifying a separate class:

Neutral
This class indicates that the user is awake and in a neutral state (not thinking or speaking). 6035 records were taken over approximately 30 seconds.

Vocalizing-Yes
This class indicates that the user is saying "Yes". 5980 records were taken over approximately 30 seconds.

Vocalizing-No:
This class indicates that the user is saying "No". 5980 records were taken over approximately 30 seconds.

Thinking-Yes
This class indicates that the user is thinking "Yes". 6119 records were taken over approximately 31 seconds.

Thinking-No
This class indicates that the user is thinking "No". 6119 records were taken over approximately 31 seconds.
